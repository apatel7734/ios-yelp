Time spent: 15 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

Search results page
 * [x] Required : Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height
 * [x] Required : Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints
 * [x] Required : Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).
 * [x] Optional : infinite scroll for restaurant results
Filter page. Unfortunately, not all the filters are supported in the Yelp API.
 * [x] Required : The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), radius (meters), deals (on/off).
 * [x] Required : The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
 * [x] Required : You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states. Optional: implement a custom switch
 * [x] Required : Radius filter should expand as in the real Yelp app
 * [x] Required : Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings. (Partial done)
TODO in-progress stories 
Optional: Implement map view of restaurant results
Categories should show a subset of the full list with a "See All" row to expand. Category list is here: http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/category_list (Links to an external site.)
Optional: Implement the restaurant detail page.
